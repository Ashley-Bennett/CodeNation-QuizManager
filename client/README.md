# Code Nation - Synoptic Project - Quiz Manager
## Preface
This is the final project set by code nation in order for me to pass the bcs exam and complete my apprenticeship. I was given an option of projects to chose from but I chose to do the quiz manager one becuase it works best for me and my tech stack. I felt most comfortable with it.

The brief was  to create a front-end website where users of varying permission levels could login and acces a database of quizzes. Certain users would be able to edit, add and delete quizes, questions and answers. 
To complete this task. I decided to use react with an express backend and a sql database to store the data.
